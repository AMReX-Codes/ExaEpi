Dependencies
============

ExaEpi depends on the following popular third party software.
Please see installation instructions below.

- a mature `C++17 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B17>`__ compiler, e.g., GCC 7, Clang 7, NVCC 11.0, MSVC 19.15 or newer
- `CMake 3.15.0+ <https://cmake.org>`__
- `Git 2.18+ <https://git-scm.com>`__
- `AMReX <https://amrex-codes.github.io>`__: we automatically download and compile a copy

Optional dependencies include:

- `MPI 3.0+ <https://www.mpi-forum.org/docs/>`__: for multi-node and/or multi-GPU execution
- `CUDA Toolkit 11.0+ <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads>`__: for Nvidia GPU support (see `matching host-compilers <https://gist.github.com/ax3l/9489132>`_)
- `OpenMP 3.1+ <https://www.openmp.org>`__: for threaded CPU execution
- `CCache <https://ccache.dev>`__: to speed up rebuilds (needs 3.7.9+ for CUDA)
- `Ninja <https://ninja-build.org>`__: for faster parallel compiles
- `Parallel HDF5 <https://github.com/HDFGroup/hdf5>`__: to write to HDF5. Parallel HDF5 is required, and modules with pre-built Parallel HDF5 installations are available on most HPC machines.
