Run ExaEpi
==========

In order to run a new simulation:

#. create a **new directory**, where the simulation will be run
#. make sure the ExaEpi **executable** is either copied into this directory or in your ``PATH`` `environment variable <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)>`__
#. add an **inputs file** and on :ref:`HPC systems <install-hpc>` a **submission script** to the directory
#. run

.. code-block:: bash

   cd <run_directory>

   # run with an inputs file:
   mpirun -np <n_ranks> ./agent <input_file>

On an :ref:`HPC system <install-hpc>`, you would instead submit the :ref:`job script <install-hpc>` at this point, e.g. ``sbatch <submission_script>`` (SLURM on Cori/NERSC) or ``bsub <submission_script>`` (LSF on Summit/OLCF).

Inputs Parameters
=================

Runtime parameters are specified in an `inputs` file, which is required to run ExaEpi.
An example `inputs` file can be bound at `ExaEpi/examples/inputs`. Below, we document
the runtime parameters than can be set in the inputs file.

The following are inputs for the overall simulation:

* ``agent.number_of_diseases`` (`integer`)
    The number of diseases to track. (Default is ``1``).
* ``agent.disease_names`` (vector of `strings`)
    Names of the diseases; the size of the vector must be the same as ``agent.number_of_diseases``.
    If unspecified, the disease names are set as ``default00``, ``default01``, ``...``.
* ``agent.ic_type`` (`string`: either ``"census"`` or ``"demo"``)
    If ``"census"``, initial conditions will be read from the provided census data file.
    If ``"demo"``, agents will be initialized according to a power law distribution.
    Note that the ``"demo"`` `ic_type` is deprecated and will be removed in the future.
* ``agent.census_filename`` (`string`)
    The path to the ``*.dat`` file containing the census data used to set initial conditions.
    Must be provided if ``ic_type`` is ``"census"``. Examples of these data files are provided
    in ``ExaEpi/data/CensusData``.
* ``agent.worker_filename`` (`string`)
    The path to the ``*.bin`` file containing worker flow information.
    Must be provided if ``ic_type`` is ``"census"``. Examples of these data files are provided
    in ``ExaEpi/data/CensusData``.
* ``agent.initial_case_type`` (vector of `strings`: each of which is either ``"random"`` or ``"file"``)
    The size of the vector must be the same as ``agent.number_of_diseases``.
    If ``random``, ``agent.num_initial_cases`` must be set.
    If ``file``, ``agent.case_filename`` must be set. Must be provided if ``ic_type`` is ``"census"``.
* ``agent.case_filename`` (`string`)
    When ``agent.number_of_diseases = 1``: The path to the ``*.cases`` file containing the initial case
    data to use. Must be provided if ``initial_case_type`` is ``"file"``. Examples of these data files
    are provided in ``ExaEpi/data/CaseData``.
* ``agent.case_filename_[disease name]`` (`string`)
    When ``agent.number_of_diseases > 1``:
    The path to the ``*.cases`` file containing the initial case data for ``[disease name]`` to use,
    where ``[disease name]`` is from the list of names specified in ``agent.disease_names`` (or the
    the default value).
    Must be provided if ``initial_case_type`` for ``[disease name]`` is ``"file"``;
    Examples of these data files are provided in ``ExaEpi/data/CaseData``.
* ``agent.num_initial_cases`` (int)
    When ``agent.number_of_diseases = 1``:  The number of initial cases to seed. Must be provided if
    ``initial_case_type`` is ``"random"``.
* ``agent.num_initial_cases_[disease name]`` (int)
    When ``agent.number_of_diseases > 1``:  The number of initial cases for to seed for ``[disease name]``,
    where ``[disease name]`` is any of the names specified in ``agent.disease_names`` (or the
    the default value).
    Must be provided if ``initial_case_type`` is ``"random"`` for ``[disease name]``.
* ``agent.nsteps`` (`integer`)
    The number of days to simulate.
* ``agent.plot_int`` (`integer`)
    The number of time steps between successive plot file writes.
* ``agent.random_travel_int`` (`integer`)
    The number of time steps between long distance travel events - note that this is
    currently only meaningful if `ic_type` = ``"census"``.
* ``agent.aggregated_diag_int``
    The number of time steps between writing aggregated data, for example wastewater data.
* ``agent.aggregated_diag_prefix`` (`string`)
    Prefix to use when writing aggregated data. For example, if this is set to `cases`, the
    aggregated data files will be named `cases000010`, etc.
* ``agent.seed`` (`long integer`)
    Use this to specify the random seed to use for the run.
* ``agent.shelter_start`` (`integer`)
    Day on which to start shelter-in-place.
* ``agent.shelter_length`` (`integer`)
    Number of days shelter in-place-is in effect.
* ``agent.shelter_compliance`` (`float`)
    Fraction of agents that comply with shelter-in-place order.
* ``agent.symptomatic_withdraw`` (`integer`, default: 1)
    Whether or not to have symptomatic agents withdraw.
* ``agent.symptomatic_withdraw_compliance`` (`float`, default: 0.95)
    Compliance rate for agents withdrawing when they have symptoms. Should be 0.0 to 1.0.
* ``agent.student_teacher_ratios`` (`list of integers`, default: ``20 20 20 20 20 1000000000``)
    This option sets the desired student-teacher ratio for High School, Middle School, Elementary School in Neighborhood 1, Elementary School in Neighborhood 2, and Day Care, respectively. A large value of this ratio indicates that there should be 0 teachers in the associated school type (e.g., by default, there are no teachers assigned to Day Care).
* ``agents.size`` (`tuple of 2 integers`: e.g. ``(1, 1)``, default: ``(1, 1)``)
    This option is deprecated and will removed in a future version of ExaEpi. It controls
    the number of cells in the domain when running in `demo` mode. During actual usage,
    this number will be overridden and is irrelevant.
* ``agent.max_grid_size`` (`integer`, default: ``16``)
    This option sets the maximum grid size used for MPI domain decomposition. If set to
    ``16``, for example, the domain will be broken up into grids of `16^2` communities, and
    these grids will be assigned to different MPI ranks / GPUs.
* ``diag.output_filename`` (vector of `strings`, default: ``output.dat``, ``output_[disease name].dat``)
    Filename for the output data; the size of the vector must be the same as ``agent.number_of_diseases``.
    The default is ``output.dat`` for ``agent.number_of_diseases = 1`` and ``output_[disease name].dat``
    for ``agent.number_of_diseases > 1``, where ``[disease name]`` is from the list of names specified
    in ``agent.disease_names`` (or the default values).


The following inputs specify the transmission parameters:

* ``contact.pSC`` (`float`, default: 0.2)
    This is contact matrix scaling factor for schools.

    This is contact matrix scaling factor for families.
* ``contact.pBAR`` (`float`, default: -1.0)
    This is contact matrix scaling factor for bars or other large social gatherings.
    Setting this to < 0 turns this transmission off.

The following inputs specify the disease parameters:

* ``disease.nstrain`` (`integer`)
    The number of disease strains we're modeling.
* ``disease.p_trans`` (`list of float`, example: ``0.2 0.3``)
    These numbers are the probability of transmission given contact. There must be
    one entry for each disease strain.

    Mean length of the incubation period in days. Before this, agents have no symptoms and are not infectious.
* ``disease.infectious_length_mean`` (`float`, default: ``6.0``)
    Mean length of the infectious period in days. This counter starts once the incubation phase is over. Before tihs, agents are symptomatic and can spread the disease.
* ``disease.symptomdev_length_mean`` (`float`, default: ``5.0``)
    Mean length of the time from exposure until symptoms develop in days. During the symptomatic-but-not-infectious stage agents  may self-withdraw, but they cannot spread the illness.

    Probability of death for age groups: under 5, 5-17, 18-29, 30-64, 65+

`Note`: for ``agent.number_of_diseases > 1``, the disease parameters that are common
to all the diseases can be specified as above. Any parameter that is `different for a specific disease`
can be specified as follows:

* ``disease_[disease name].[key] = [value]``

where ``[disease name]`` is any of the names specified in ``agent.disease_names`` (or the
default value), and ``[key]`` is any of the parameters listed above.

In addition to the ExaEpi inputs, there are also a number of runtime options that can be configured for AMReX itself. Please see <https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex/docs_html/GPU.html#inputs-parameters>`__ for more information on these options.
