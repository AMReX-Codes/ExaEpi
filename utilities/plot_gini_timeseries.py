"""Plot how geographically widespread infections are over time, via either the Gini coefficient or
global Moran's I of per-tract (or per-county) infected counts each day, for ExaEpi and/or Epicast.

Gini (--metric gini, the default) measures CONCENTRATION only, independent of geography: 0 means
infections are spread perfectly evenly across every tract/county, ->1 means they're concentrated in
very few -- it doesn't care whether the affected units are next to each other or scattered across
the map. It needs no shapefile, only each unit's infected count (from
load_exaepi_grid_stats/reconstruct_epicast_snapshot's GEOID10-keyed DataFrame).

Global Moran's I (--metric moran) measures spatial AUTOCORRELATION instead: ~+1 means neighboring
tracts/counties tend to have similar infection levels (a contiguous outbreak region), ~0 means the
pattern is spatially random, ~-1 means neighbors tend to differ sharply (a checkerboard pattern).
This needs a shapefile (--shape_files) to build a queen-contiguity adjacency matrix (two units are
neighbors if their boundaries touch), built once per data source and reused across every day, since
the geographic units and their adjacency don't change -- only each day's infected values do.

Both sides are always compared at Census tract granularity at minimum (ExaEpi's block groups are
summed up to their tract, same as plot_geo.py's --tract_level; Epicast is natively tract-level)
since that's the finest resolution common to both, and the whole point is a fair comparison. Pass
--county_level to aggregate both further, up to the county.
