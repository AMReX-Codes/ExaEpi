"""Shared matplotlib styling for every plot_geo*/plot_group_size*/plot_gini_timeseries.py figure
going into the emerge paper (a PLOS Computational Biology submission), so they all look like one
consistent set rather than each script's own ad hoc font sizes and aspect ratios.

Font sizes (8-12pt, using the low end: 8/9/10pt), font family (Arial -- PLOS allows "Arial, Times,
or Symbol" only), and line width (~0.2mm, PLOS's own guidance) come from PLOS's figure spec
(https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/s/figures). But figure WIDTH here is calibrated against how
the figures are actually placed in the paper's LaTeX source, NOT PLOS's spec for the submitted
file's own resolution -- those are two different numbers, and conflating them is what makes text
come out too small. PLOS's 5.2in/7.5in figures describe the physical size PLOS's own production
pipeline re-embeds a submitted file at (from its pixel dimensions and DPI) -- that's irrelevant to
how the file displays in the author's own compiled draft, which is governed entirely by whatever
\\includegraphics[width=...] fraction of \\linewidth the author actually uses. Since fonts are drawn
into the raster/vector at a fixed point size, LaTeX scaling the whole image down to fit that width
scales the fonts down with it -- so a figure must be authored at (or very near) its ACTUAL final
display width for an 8-12pt font to still read as 8-12pt on the page.

This paper places half-page figures at 0.48\\linewidth and full-page ones at \\linewidth, in the
PLOS LaTeX template (\\linewidth ~= 6.5in for that template's single-column body text):
  - half-page width = 0.48 * 6.5in ~= 3.12in
  - full-page width  = 1.00 * 6.5in ~= 6.5in
If the actual compiled PDF ever shows these noticeably larger or smaller than intended, that means
\\linewidth in the real document differs from 6.5in -- recalculate both widths from the actual value
rather than adjusting font sizes to compensate (that would just reintroduce the same mismatch this
module exists to avoid).

HALF_PAGE_HEIGHT_IN gives every ordinary (non-map) single-panel half-page plot the same 4:3 aspect
ratio, so they read as one consistent set rather than each script's own inherited shape -- a
choropleth/map script is the one legitimate exception (its aspect ratio is fixed by real geography,
not a free style choice), and multi-panel figures instead pick a height from their own per-panel
content.

Usage: call apply_style() once near the top of main(), before creating any figure, and use
HALF_PAGE_WIDTH_IN / FULL_PAGE_WIDTH_IN (plus HALF_PAGE_HEIGHT_IN where relevant) as the figure size
when calling plt.subplots(figsize=...).
