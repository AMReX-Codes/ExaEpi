"""Shared, dependency-light geographic-aggregation helper for the plot_geo* scripts.

Deliberately has no imports beyond the standard library -- plot_geo.py needs both yt (for ExaEpi
plotfiles) and read_epicast_events (for Epicast), but neither of those should be required just to
reuse this one function, so it lives on its own rather than in that module.
