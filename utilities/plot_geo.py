"""Plot ExaEpi and/or Epicast infection-spread choropleths over a sequence of days.

Pass --exaepi_dir alone to plot only ExaEpi (one row), --events_file alone to plot only Epicast
(one row), or both together to plot them stacked in two rows (Epicast on top, ExaEpi below) with
each day's column additionally labeled with that day's log-scale Pearson r and RMSLE of raw infected
COUNT (see compare_day() for how these are computed and what they mean, and why they're shown here
instead of the rate-based rho/r/RMSE compare_day() also returns -- those can look deceptively good
once an epidemic has mostly burned out) -- a per-community comparison that plot_geo_compare.py also
uses (importing the loaders and compare_day from here) to plot the rate-based quantities as a
day-scalar time series instead.

Days are given explicitly as a list (--day), since a single day value has to resolve independently
to an Epicast snapshot (reconstructed from the events log) and/or a matching ExaEpi per-day file
(looked up by the day parsed from its name) -- there's no single natural sequence of "days" shared
by both data sources the way there is for ExaEpi's own per-day files alone.

Epicast's finest geographic unit is the Census tract, not the block group ExaEpi communities use --
so ExaEpi is aggregated up to the tract by default (or further to the county, with
--county_level), and a tract (or county) shapefile is required via --shape_files, not a block group
one, whenever Epicast is involved.

    (a "day" half-step and a "night" half-step) per calendar day. To get a "snapshot as of the
    start of day D" comparable to ExaEpi's own day-D data (written before day D's own dynamics run

    right there instead, at timestep 0. Without this exception (i.e. the plain 2*day-1 formula
    extended to day 0), day 0 would already include day 0's own night-half dynamics -- which lets
    already-seeded agents' disease-state progression get logged from wherever they physically are

    rho/r/rmse are the Spearman rank correlation, infection-weighted Pearson correlation, and
    infection-weighted RMSE of infection RATE (infected / pop) between the two. Rate rather than raw
    infected count is compared so that communities of very different population size are compared on
    a like-for-like basis. r and rmse are weighted by each community's average infected count
    (across the two simulators) rather than its population, so that a community currently at or near
    zero infection doesn't get outsized influence just because it has a large population -- a rate
    difference there is mostly noise, whereas the same difference in a heavily-infected community
    reflects a real, larger-magnitude disagreement. The corollary is that once an epidemic has mostly
    burned out and every community's rate is near zero, rmse necessarily shrinks toward zero right
    along with it (two numbers close to zero can't differ by much in absolute terms) even if the two
    simulators agree poorly on which of the few remaining cases are where -- rmse alone can look
    deceptively good late in a run.

    r_log/rmse_log are a log-scale counterpart computed on raw infected COUNT (not rate), unweighted
    (every community counted equally), matching what the choropleth itself actually shows: it colors
    every community by log(infected count) with no population weighting, so a small community's count
    going from 2 to 20 is exactly as visible on the map as a large community's count going from 200 to
    2000 -- a difference the rate-based rmse above washes out once both counts are small relative to
    population. rmse_log is the root-mean-square log error (RMSLE), on log1p(count) so a count of 0 is
    still defined; unlike rmse, it stays sensitive to disagreement in the residual tail of a mostly-
    resolved epidemic, which is exactly where rmse's near-zero-by-construction floor is least
    informative. rho isn't given a log counterpart since Spearman rank correlation is unchanged by any
    monotonic transform (log included) of the values it ranks.

    merged_df carries a rate_exaepi/rate_epicast column per matched community (GEOID10) -- the
    community-by-community comparison underlying the summary scalars, for callers that want to look
    beyond them. Returns (None, None, None, None, None, None, n, merged_df) if fewer than two
