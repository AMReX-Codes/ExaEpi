"""Compare an ExaEpi run against an Epicast run over a sequence of days, at the level of individual
communities (see plot_geo.py for the single-choropleth-per-day view this builds on, and for the
loaders and compare_day() this reuses). Two outputs are produced:
  - a day-scalar summary plot of infection-weighted Pearson's r: correlation of the raw infection
    rates, weighted by how much infection is actually present in each community (see compare_day
    for why weighting this way rather than by population). Plotted as two series, tract-level and
    county-level r computed independently from the same underlying data, so the plot also shows
    whether the two simulators' agreement holds up across geographic granularity or is an artifact
    of one particular level.
  - a community-by-community scatter plot, one panel per day: ExaEpi infection rate vs Epicast
    infection rate, one point per matched community, with a y=x reference line -- the full
    per-community comparison underlying that day's scalars, for spotting which specific communities
    the two simulators disagree on. This one is still at a single geographic level, chosen by
    --county_level (tract by default), since a scatter plot with both levels overlaid would just
    superimpose two point clouds at different resolutions.

Both simulators' loaders already return a per-community DataFrame keyed by GEOID10 (see
load_exaepi_grid_stats / reconstruct_epicast_snapshot), so the two are simply merged on GEOID10 per
day. Epicast's finest geographic unit is the Census tract, so tract level is the finest granularity
at which the two can be compared; county level aggregates further.

If the two runs' start dates aren't aligned (e.g. one simulator was seeded a few days later in
epidemic progression than the other), pass --exaepi_day_shift to re-time the ExaEpi day parsed from
each file before it's matched against Epicast -- everything downstream (the Epicast day looked up,
the r values, the reported/plotted day) is computed from that shifted day.
