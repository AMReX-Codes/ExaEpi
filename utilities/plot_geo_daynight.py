"""Plot an ExaEpi choropleth of daytime-minus-nighttime population per Census tract (or county).

Nighttime population = agents counted by home cell; daytime population = the same agents counted
by work/school cell instead. Agents with no separate work/school location assigned (retirees,
preschoolers, ...) have work_i/work_j == home_i/home_j, so they contribute equally to both and
don't affect the difference; agents who work/attend school locally (same grid cell as home)
likewise net out to zero even though they do have a job/school assigned.

Positive (red) tracts gain population during the day (workplace/school destinations); negative
(blue) tracts lose population (bedroom communities). This is the direct ExaEpi analogue of the
Epicast day/night investigation -- unlike Epicast's run.events.bin (which only records a location
for an agent's single exposure event, so household- and work/school-exposed agents are mutually
exclusive and can never be paired into a home+work commute), ExaEpi's static, once-per-run
day/night population CSV (see below) is built from every agent's explicit home_i/home_j/work_i/
work_j pair, so this is an exact reconstruction, not a partial/biased sample.

Population comes from the static, once-per-run <prefix>_day_night_population.csv ExaEpi writes
when --aggregated_diag_int is enabled (see ExaEpi::IO::writeStaticAggregatedData in src/IO.cpp,
and plot_geo.load_exaepi_day_night_population) -- already broken out by everyone/workers/students,
so no plotfile/agent data is needed at all.

Pass --population workers or --population students to restrict the whole analysis (both the
night/home and day/work side) to just that subset of agents, instead of everyone -- e.g.
--population workers isolates commuting to workplaces from the (usually larger, more local)
school-run pattern. This is purely a choice of which pre-computed CSV columns to use, not a
recomputation -- the CSV always carries all three breakdowns.
