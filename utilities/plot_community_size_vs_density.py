"""Plot ExaEpi community size (population per community) against population density (people /
km^2) for one ExaEpi plotfile directory, as two overlaid series: nighttime (home-based) and
daytime (work-based) population.

Each ExaEpi community is one AMReX grid cell. Nighttime population counts agents by home cell
(home_i, home_j); daytime population counts the same agents by work/school cell (work_i,
work_j) instead -- agents with no separate work/school location (retirees, preschoolers, ...)
have work_i/work_j == home_i/home_j, so they contribute equally to both. This is the same
home/work reconstruction plot_geo_daynight.py uses; see its docstring for why it's an exact,
unbiased census of every agent rather than a partial sample.

Density is computed from the same Census block group shapefiles (GEOID10 + ALAND10 land area,
via --shape_files): when a Census unit's population exceeds 2000, ExaEpi splits it into several
communities (grid cells) that all share the same GEOID10 and therefore the same land area, so
this is a many-communities-to-one-area join, not one-to-one. Land area doesn't depend on the run,
but population does (nighttime vs daytime) -- unlike land area, so is *not* static across a run's
other plotfiles for a residential-vs-workplace split like this one.

Population comes from the static, once-per-run <prefix>_day_night_population.csv ExaEpi writes
when --aggregated_diag_int is enabled (see ExaEpi::IO::writeStaticAggregatedData in src/IO.cpp,
and plot_geo.load_exaepi_day_night_population) -- already per-community, so no plotfile/agent data
is needed at all.
