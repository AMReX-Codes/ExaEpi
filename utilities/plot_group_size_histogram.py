"""Plot a histogram of ExaEpi community/neighborhood sizes, or of neighborhoods per
community, from a run's plotfile.

Community size is plotted as two overlaid series: agents grouped by home (home_i, home_j)
-- the residential/nighttime population per community -- and by work (work_i, work_j) --
the daytime population (every agent has a work_i/work_j: a real job/school site for
workers/students, or straight to home_i/home_j for everyone else).

Neighborhood size is the number of agents in a given (community, neighborhood) pair --
neighborhood IDs are only unique within a community, so agents are grouped by the
(home_i, home_j, nborhood) triple.

Neighborhoods per community is the number of distinct neighborhood IDs among the agents
living in each community.

All three read per-agent fields (home_i/j, work_i/j, nborhood) that are only written to
the first plotfile of a run (typically plt00000), so this script requires that file.
