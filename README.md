This is a demo for an Agent-based epidemiology code built using the AMReX framework.

For more information about AMReX:
    website: https://amrex-codes.github.io/
    documentation: https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex/docs_html/
    source code: https://github.com/AMReX-Codes/amrex

## Building the code

This demo uses CMake version 3.14 or higher. To build it:
     mkdir build
     cd build
     cmake ..
     make -j8

To build with GPU support, use the `-DAMReX_GPU_BACKEND=CUDA` CMake option.

To write output as (compressed) HDF5, use the `-DAMReX_HDF5=TRUE` CMake option.
Compression level can be altered in src/IO.cpp file. The environment variable
HDF5_CHUNK_SIZE controls the chunk size if compression is used. A value of 
around 100,000 is recommended to start.

For convenience, a script for setting up the module environment for Perlmutter is
provided in etc/perlmutter_environment.sh. To use it, do:

    source etc/perlmutter_environment.sh

## Running the code

Navigate to build/bin and run the executable using one of the "inputs" files in "examples".

For example:
    cd build/bin
    ./agent ../../examples/inputs

## Looking at the output

Running the code succesfully will create a number of "plt?????" files. You can visualize
these using the script at etc/plot.py. This will require the "yt" package to be installed:
